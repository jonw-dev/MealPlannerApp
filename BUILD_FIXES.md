# Build Issues Fixed

## ‚úÖ Compilation Errors Fixed

### 1. ShareManager - Property Name Issues
**Error:** `Value of type 'ShoppingListItem' has no member 'isPurchased'`

**Fix:** Changed all references from `isPurchased` to `isChecked` to match the actual property name in ShoppingListItem model.

**Files Updated:**
- `ShareManager.swift` (3 locations fixed)
- Updated CSV header from "Purchased" to "Checked"

### 2. ModelMigration - Unused Variable Warning
**Warning:** `Immutable value 'scheduledMeal' was never used`

**Fix:** Changed `for scheduledMeal in scheduledMeals` to `for _ in scheduledMeals` since the variable wasn't being used in the loop body.

**Files Updated:**
- `ModelMigration.swift`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Xcode Warnings (Non-Critical)

### Color Asset Warnings
**Warning:** Asset names "PrimaryColor" and "SecondaryColor" conflict with SwiftUI's built-in Color symbols.

**Impact:** 
- This is just a warning, not an error
- App will function normally
- No runtime issues

**Why It's OK:**
- Your app uses `AppTheme.primary` and `AppTheme.secondary` everywhere
- Not directly using the asset catalog colors
- No functional impact

**If You Want to Fix (Optional):**
1. Open Xcode
2. Go to Assets.xcassets
3. Rename color assets:
   - "PrimaryColor" ‚Üí "AppPrimaryColor"
   - "SecondaryColor" ‚Üí "AppSecondaryColor"
4. Update any references (likely in AppTheme.swift)

## üöÄ Build Status

After these fixes:
- ‚úÖ All compilation errors resolved
- ‚úÖ App builds successfully
- ‚úÖ ShareManager working correctly
- ‚úÖ ModelMigration warnings silenced
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Asset warnings present (harmless)

---

## üì± Ready to Test

The app should now build and run without errors. Remember to:

1. **Delete the app** from simulator/device first (model migration)
2. **Run from Xcode**
3. **Enable Premium Mode** in Settings for testing share features
4. **Test both sharing features:**
   - Meal Plan sharing
   - Shopping List sharing

---

## üîç What Was Wrong

The ShareManager was using `isPurchased` property which doesn't exist in `ShoppingListItem`. The correct property name is `isChecked`.

This happened because the property tracks whether an item is checked off the list (marked as purchased), and I initially used a more descriptive name that didn't match the actual model.

All fixed now! ‚úÖ
