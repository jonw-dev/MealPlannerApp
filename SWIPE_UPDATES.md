# Swipe Actions & Change Meal UI Updates

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Swipe Actions Now Working** 👈

**Problem:** Swipe actions weren't appearing because `.swipeActions()` only works in `List` views, not in `VStack/ForEach`.

**Solution:** Created custom `SwipeableMealCard` component with manual drag gesture.

#### How It Works Now:
- **Swipe left** on any meal card
- Reveals two action buttons:
  - **Change** (Orange) - 80pt wide
  - **Delete** (Red) - 80pt wide
- **Smooth animation** using spring effect
- **Tap elsewhere** to close swipe
- **Drag back right** to close swipe

### 2. **Improved Change Meal UI** ✅❌

**Problem:** Only showing checkmark (✓) for current and blue circle for selected was confusing.

**Solution:** Clear visual indicators:

#### States:

**Initial State (No Selection):**
```
Current Meal                        ✓ (blue)
Other Meals                         (no icon)
```

**After Selecting New Meal:**
```
New Selected Meal                   ✓ (green)
Current Meal (will be removed)      ✗ (red)
Other Meals                         (no icon)
```

#### Visual Feedback:
- ✓ Green = This will be the new meal
- ✗ Red = This meal will be removed
- Clear contrast between add/remove

## 🎨 Swipe Gesture Details

### Implementation:

**Custom Drag Gesture:**
```swift
DragGesture()
    .onChanged { value in
        // Only allow left swipe (negative translation)
        if translation < 0 {
            offset = max(translation, -buttonWidth * 2)
        }
    }
    .onEnded { value in
        // Snap to open or closed
        if offset < -buttonWidth {
            offset = -buttonWidth * 2  // Fully open
        } else {
            offset = 0  // Closed
        }
    }
```

### Features:

1. **Left Swipe Only** - Prevents right swipe
2. **Snap Animation** - Smoothly opens to show buttons
3. **Tap to Close** - Tap anywhere to close swipe
4. **Context Menu Still Works** - Long-press still shows menu
5. **Tap to View** - Normal tap opens detail (if not swiped)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### SwipeableMealCard Component

**Props:**
```swift
let meal: Meal
let onTap: () -> Void
let onDelete: () -> Void
let onChange: () -> Void
```

**State:**
```swift
@State private var offset: CGFloat = 0
@State private var isSwiping = false
```

**Layout:**
```
ZStack:
  ├─ Action Buttons (Change + Delete)
  │    ├─ Change (Orange, 80pt)
  │    └─ Delete (Red, 80pt)
  └─ Main Meal Card (with offset)
```

**Gesture Logic:**
- Left swipe: `offset` goes negative
- Right swipe (when open): `offset` returns to 0
- Snap threshold: -80pt (half of button width)
- Animation: Spring effect for smooth feel
