# RevenueCat Implementation - Final Steps

## ✅ Code Implementation Complete!

I've implemented all the RevenueCat code for your app with your pricing:
- **Weekly:** £0.79
- **Monthly:** £2.49
- **Annual:** £19.99

---

## 📋 Final Steps to Complete

### **Step 1: Add RevenueCat SDK to Xcode** (5 minutes)

1. Open your project in Xcode
2. Go to **File** → **Add Package Dependencies...**
3. Paste this URL: `https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios`
4. Click **"Add Package"**
5. Select **"Purchases"** library
6. Click **"Add Package"**

---

### **Step 2: Add Your RevenueCat API Key** (2 minutes)

1. Go to your RevenueCat dashboard
2. Go to **Project Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Copy your **Public App-Specific API Key**
   - Should look like: `appl_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

4. In Xcode, open `MealPlannerApp.swift`
5. Find this line (around line 21):
   ```swift
   Purchases.configure(withAPIKey: "YOUR_REVENUECAT_API_KEY_HERE")
   ```

6. Replace `"YOUR_REVENUECAT_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual key:
   ```swift
   Purchases.configure(withAPIKey: "appl_YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY")
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Update Product IDs** (2 minutes)

In `RevenueCatManager.swift`, update the product IDs to match your App Store Connect products:

```swift
enum ProductID: String {
    case weekly = "YOUR_WEEKLY_PRODUCT_ID"     // £0.79
    case monthly = "YOUR_MONTHLY_PRODUCT_ID"   // £2.49
    case annual = "YOUR_ANNUAL_PRODUCT_ID"     // £19.99
}
```

**Example:**
```swift
enum ProductID: String {
    case weekly = "meal_planner_premium_weekly"
    case monthly = "meal_planner_premium_monthly"
    case annual = "meal_planner_premium_annual"
}
```

---

### **Step 4: Verify RevenueCat Dashboard Setup**

Make sure you've completed in RevenueCat:

✅ **Products Created:**
- [ ] Weekly subscription (meal_planner_premium_weekly)
- [ ] Monthly subscription (meal_planner_premium_monthly)
- [ ] Annual subscription (meal_planner_premium_annual)

✅ **Entitlement Created:**
- [ ] Identifier: `premium`
- [ ] All three products attached to it

✅ **Offering Created:**
- [ ] Identifier: `default`

  - `$rc_weekly` → weekly product → premium entitlement
  - `$rc_monthly` → monthly product → premium entitlement

- [ ] Offering marked as "Current"
